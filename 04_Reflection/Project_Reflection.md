# Project Reflection (Summary)

- Strengthened practical skills in VLAN design, nftables policy writing, and local DNS.
- Validated segmentation with `ping`/`curl` and DNS resolution with `dig`, capturing screenshots as evidence.
- Key learning: apply least-privilege by default and open access per role (Admin full; Staff → Servers+Internet; Students/Guests → Internet only; IoT → DNS/NTP only; Teachers → Internet and management zones as needed).
- Next steps: add DHCP scopes per VLAN, introduce DNS/web filtering for Students/Guests, and automate deploys with Ansible.
